# Magenta RT — Reverb × Low‑Pass Filter

A fine‑tuned **Magenta RealTime (Magenta RT)** checkpoint + **Colab notebook** that streams audio generation and lets you **toggle Reverb + Low‑Pass Filter live** on the drum stem.

This is a personal side-project from me and keeps **all control in lane 0** (no extra lanes) to reduce style/control entanglement, altough it is not totally avoidable.

## Quickstart (Colab)

1. Open `demo.ipynb` in Colab  (recommend to use v6e-1 TPU since it's tested on there)
2. Run cells top → bottom. Replace system.py with the system.py script in this repo and restart runtime.
3. Set `HF_REPO_ID` + `CHECKPOINT_SUBDIR` in the “Load checkpoint” cell  
4. Click **Start** in the streaming widget  
5. Use **Reverb** + **LPF** toggles while it plays (applies on the next ~2s chunk)  
6. Toggle **record** → click **save wav** to download your recording

## Control scheme (single lane)

I used the vocab gap (after codec vocab, before style vocab):

- `VOCAB_CONTROL_OFFSET = vocab_codec_offset + vocab_codec_size`
- `control_token = VOCAB_CONTROL_OFFSET + state_id`
- `state_id = reverb_id * 4 + lpf_id`

Where:

- `reverb_id`: `0=dry`, `1=light`, `2=medium`, `3=heavy`
- `lpf_id`: `0=open`, `1=light`, `2=medium`, `3=heavy`

### Why lane‑0 only?

Earlier experiments that used multiple lanes for control got **entangled** with style lanes.  
Lane‑0-only control (and keeping lanes 1–5 as real MusicCoCa style tokens) stays much cleaner.

## System patch (required)

The notebook applies a small patch to `magenta_rt/system.py`.:

- After `style_tokens_lm` is computed, we do:
  - `style_tokens_lm[0] = self._control_lane0_token` (if set)

This means:

- Lane 0 → control token (our state)
- Lanes 1–5 → normal MusicCoCa style tokens (matches training)

---

## Alternative attempted approach (token appending)

Also tried an approach where control tokens were appended to the prompt sequence (extra tokens after context/style).  
It did not work as well as lane‑0 override: the model tended to ignore the appended controls or behave inconsistently.

---

## Training data (high level)

Training used a mixture of:

- **Slakh2100** (audio files + our own renderings based on MIDI)
- **MUSDB** and other **stem‑separated** music
- FX augmentation via **Pedalboard** (reverb + low‑pass filter variants)

## Repo contents

- `demo.ipynb` — Colab notebook (install → patch → load checkpoint → live UI)
- `requirements.txt` — minimal local deps (Colab uses install cells)
- `setup.py` - patch
